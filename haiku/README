README for building Scintilla for Haiku

Create directory named haiku in main directory of Scintilla and copy all files
there.

Now you can use the makefile provided. Compiled library will be in ../bin.
Make sure you are using GCC4, it will not compile with GCC2.

There is no SciTE port available.

The port is still missing a few things:
- Idler implementation
- Custom icons support

IME support:
You can set your own colors for clauses and selection, customize styles
253 and 254, respectively.

This revision is compatible with Scintilla 3.6.5.
